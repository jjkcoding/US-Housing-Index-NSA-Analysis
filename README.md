# US-Index-NSA-Analysis

## Description:
Because of my interest to travel around the world, I wanted to know and compare the housing prices of all the states in the U.S. I was able to get a dataset from the Federal Housing Finance Agency website (https://www.fhfa.gov/DataTools/Downloads/Pages/House-Price-Index-Datasets.aspx). Using this data, I was able to view the positive upward trend of the housing prices over time shown below.

Furthermore, I was able plot a bar chart of the housing prices for each state to display the least and most expensive states to live in the U.S.

I was also able to plot the above plot as a choropleth to visually see correlations between the housing prices and locations on the U.S.

Finally, I created a fun animated bar chart of how the index nsa changed over time. However, it was too big to display on the github or on the Google Colab. If you run the code, it would take around 15 minutes to make and download. 


## What I Learned:
From a data analytical stand point, I was able to further expand my knowledge in filtering and adjusting datasets. Moreover, I was able to further my knowledge in creating nice bar charts and choropleths to help myself in future data analysis projects. From my personal stand point, I am now planning on exploring moving to Texas, Michigan, or any of the central states for cheaper housing prices in the future. Overall, this was a fun data analysis project and hopefully a beneficial reference for future projects.
